<h1>I present to you...
    </h1>
    <h1>Scott C Davis The Second</h1>
<body>

    

   <h2>Today I will be showing you some examples of all the things i've learned in this programming class</h2>
    <p>First as you can see the background is a white and purplish color. That shows that not only do I know how to code 
        code in css but it also shows that I know how to connect it too HTML
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Second, below you will see clickable buttons which is probably my favorite
        because if you are not a coder, presenting buttons probably looks like black magic.
    </p>
    <button class="funWithButtons" onclick="start();"  id="startButton">Start</button>
    <br>
    <button class="funWithButtons" onclick="stop();" id="stopButton" disabled="true">Stop</button>
    <br>
